# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
#Git is a place that tracks your code and sees any differences, Github is a place that lets you share and store your projcets, while Git bash lets you run the commands
# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
#The comamand line is a place that allows you to type commands, while the terminal is an application that give cyou direct access to the your command line.
# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
#Powershell is like the terminal but for windows and its mostly the same and is instantly installed on windows while Git is something you have to install for Windows
# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
#Python is a programming language like C++ or Java, while conda is something that installs Python and manages it, then Acaconda is a set-up that has both packs of Python and conda inside it.
# 5) What is VS Code? 
#VS Code is a code editor system that has its own comand line, it runs pyton but also runs many other things. Allows Git extensions.
# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
#Jupyter Notebook is an interface for running code and writing it, while JupyterLab is a place that includes more things for code, tools like a fiel browser and such.
# 7) What does ~/ mean?
#this is a shortway to get badck to your home directory 
# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
#An abs path is a full path that starts form the root of your system directory. Then a relative is a path to your current directory which is directions from where you are in your current file. 
# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
#If you were in "Michael" then what you would do is: /Users/michaeljoliver/Python_Decal_Fall2025/Michael/course_assignments/homework2, and then a relative path from Michael to homework2 would be: /course_assignments/Homework2
# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
#The command that allows that would be cd .. which shoves you up a directory
# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
#rm would delete a file and then ./ would mean the current direcotry so rm ./ would delete the current directory that you're in
# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add
#This would add whatever you're working on to be changed and adds it to a "to be changed" sections in your terminal
# git commit
#that this saves your code at its present moment of when you applied it for change. 
# git push
#Git push shoves that snapshot and commits to your local GitHub repository

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
#git add . adds all the changes in your direcotry and other folders to be committed, while the git add (file) is only for one specific file to be committed
# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
#Git status shows the status of whats changed, whats staged, and what you're specifically looking at. Then git log -1 shows a recent commit in the past
# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
#cloning a repository is downloading an entire repository for the first time from Git, which is the local copy. Pulling updates your direfctory with new commits from Github
# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
#the most frustrating is defintley when I'm trying to push something to the origin but its not working and then I need to find a whole work around, I ended up asking how to move it from master to origin.
# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
#A question I still have would be, how to remmeber all the multiuple commands in such a short time casue It's a little hard to remmeber everything
# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
#I really like video games, I like Destiny 2, I also like Daft Punk!
# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far.
#I really like:
print(50//5)
 #This uses division but then also shows the remainder of what you're dividing, its helpful casue long division is somtimes a pain in the butt 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
